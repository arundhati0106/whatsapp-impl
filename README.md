# whatsapp-impl
## Technology Used
Java
Spring Boot, Maven
IntelliJ Idea
HashMap

## Features
Exceptional handing in each case-
Create a user by providing a name and mobile number, if mobile already exists, throw exception
Create a group by providing a list of users, with multiple checks
Create a message by providing the message content
Change admin of group, with multiple checks

## Additional features
Remove user from a group, given that user is in group, ans is not the admin
Find messages within a set period of time (date)

## Further Exploration
Use database instead of Hashmap, with JPA Hibernate, and store values in multiple entity layers instead.
